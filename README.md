# Snippets
Simple java project containing the code snippets for various useful utility programs

## TODO:

1. Create a parent pom allowing the individual projects to be inside for e.g. when mvn clean install is triggered, then it should generate the FileOperations-1.0.jar as one jar and if anything else is added then same should be generated there.
